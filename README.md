## Data Analysis with Excel Tools
Microsoft Excel program is one of the tools commonly used in the business world to conduct data analysis. I have used the Microsoft Excel tool to complete the data analysis of this project. Some of the main excel features that I have used to complete this project are: 
- Excel Sheet formatting
- Conditional Formatting
- VLOOKUP
- COUNTIF
- Pivot Table
- Charts
## Project Overview
We have an extensive dataset that shows different campaign project outcomes based on various categories executed in multiple countries. The various categories are Film and Video, Food, Games, Journalism, Music, Photography, Publishing, Technology and Theater. Each of these categories has several subcategories. Our interest is focused on the primary category **"Theater"** and subcategory **"Plays"** and create a data analysis report to see the campaign outcome. As mentioned above, we will be using various excel tools to reformat the dataset to generate the data analysis report.
### Project Purpose
The purpose of this analysis project was to evaluate the campaign success and failure rate focused on the primary category **"Theater"** and subcategory **"Plays"** based on project Launch Date and project Goals.
### Analysis and Challenges
The first challenge was the dataset was not organized and structured in the desired manner. The data set had lots of unwanted information, which we do not need to complete the analysis. For example, the dataset shows campaign results based on Film and Video, Food, Games, Journalism, Music, Photography, Publishing, and Technology that are not in our interest. I have used excel tools such as VLOOKUP, COUNTIF, and Pivot Table to clean up the master dataset and organize it the way I need it. The second challenge was some of the data in the excel sheet is formatted incorrectly. For example, the campaign launch date and end date information provided in an incorrect format. I have used correct data formatting options to decode the date information.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The graph **"Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png"** shows that the campaign success rate has a seasonality behavior. It means that the campaign launched in May and June has a higher success rate than any other months in the year. The campaign success rate trend is increasing from the beginning of the year and reaches the highest success rate in May and June and then gradually declines towards the end of the year. The highest success rate achieved in May, and the lowest success rate noted in December. Based on this analysis, the company will achieve the best campaign results if they pledge more money from April to July.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The graph **"Outcomes_vs_Goals.png"** shows that the campaign success rate is directly dependent on each campaign's goal setting. The company got the highest success rate, 80%, when it set the campaign goal between $35K and $39K. The lowest success rate, 0%, occurred when it set the campaign goal between $45K to $49K. Based on this analysis, the company may get the best results if they put the campaign goal between $35K to $44.99K.
## Summary
We successfully analyzed the campaign success rate based on campaign launch data and campaign goal with available data. In this case, we have used a line chart to display our results. Instead of a line chart, we can also use Histogram or Scatter Plot to display the results. Another important finding is that there are some limitations when we use excel for data analysis. One of the most significant drawbacks of excl sheet analysis is that it has limitations in processing the data's size. As a result, while we work, the page may hand or freeze, and we may lose the data. Therefore, if we are working with historical data, and if the data size is large, excel sheet analysis is not a good choice.
